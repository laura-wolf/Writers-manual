# Writers-manual
This will be a guide for mHealth writers in production of software documentation.
Initial author: Laura Wolf, at MD2K.  Other mobile health writers or programmers are free to contribute to the document, but please remember that this document is being written for the benefit of non-programmer technical writers.  
Usage: This document will attempt to serve as a model from which to follow in building the documentation.

The software's README file typically contains the following information for programmers and users:

Configuration instructions

Installation instructions

Operating instructions

Table of Contents or File Manifest

Copyright and licensing information

Contact information for the software distributer or programmer

Known bugs and instructions for reporting bugs

Troubleshooting

Credits, acknowledgements

A changelog for programmers

FAQ section is optional

TODO file listing possible future changes is optional

# Operating instructions
While it is quite tempting to jump into the writing process, you will be better served by taking some more preparatory steps:
1) The writer should get a complete set of hardware and downloaded software that a user would get.  This may include power supply, or replicate components (for example right and left sensors).
2) The writer should get a beginning to end walk through of the system from the programmer or distributer.  If there is any early stage drafts of user purpose documents, then they should be gathered as well.  
3) The writer should define the user audience of the software documentation.  Within this definition, cognitive expectations should be outlined.  The writer will use this definition to decide at what level of foundation information needs to be included in the doucment or training product.  The writer will also use this opportunity to search for any other user characteristics that will have to be considered in the doucment/training design.       ADD LINK TO EXAMPLE
4) Decide on Aesthetics---colors, shape/type of highlighting in visual aids, get buy in on scope from customer/leader.  
5) Decide and document delivery method---recorded video, screencasted video, text with images, user manual in pdf file, user manual in README file, public/private.

## README file formatting Effects
Formatting effects are limited in README files.  We can use the following methods to provide visual organizers for the reader:
- bulleted lists
- Up to 6 boldface heading options, by using 1-6 hashtag marks.  This image demonstrates how the bulleted list and boldfacing formats are accomplished.  ![boldface and list 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12416186/8012106/45eb5576-0b84-11e5-9ed8-8c833b7b9a46.png)
- Images
  - Although Github doesn't currently allow direct uploading of an image file to the project repository, there is a work around.  Prepare the image that you want to include in the document.  Then in the repository create an "issue" and drag and drop the image file(s) into the issue Write window and then submit the issue.  Github will store the image and assign a link; copy that link and paste it into the README file where you want it.
- Hyperlinks
  - If you type a URL into a README file line, then Github will automatically convert that into a clickable link.  
  - If you want a link attached to some text, then here's directions and an example:
  - ![linking with image 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12416186/8014620/dda3f766-0b97-11e5-9062-500b8fe93e1c.png)

  - If you want a link attached to a button, then
- Highlighting with font change
- Spacing
